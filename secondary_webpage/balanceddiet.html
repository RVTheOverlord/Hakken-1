                    Eating a variety of foods from all food groups can help supply 
                    the nutrients a person needs as they age. A healthy eating plan
                    emphasizes fruit, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat or 
                    fat-free dairy; includes lean meat, poultry, fish, beans, eggs 
                    and nuts; and is low in saturated fats, trans fats, salt (sodium) 
                    and added sugars.
