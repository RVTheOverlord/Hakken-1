                Is your sleep different than it used to be when you were younger? It happens to a lot of people.<br />
                Nearly half of men and women over the age of 65 say they have at least one sleep problem. With age,
                many people get insomnia or have other sleep disorders.<br />
                It’s true that as we get older, our sleep patterns change. In general, older people sleep less,
                wake up and go back to sleep more often, and spend less time in deep sleep or dreaming
                than younger people.

            <h2 class="subs">IMPROVE YOUR SLEEPING HABITS...</h2>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><b>Naturally boost your melatonin levels:</b> Artificial lights at night can suppress your body’s 
                production of melatonin, the hormone that makes you sleepy. Use low-wattage bulbs where safe to do so,
                and turn off the TV and computer at least one hour before bed.</li>
                <li><b>Comfort while sleeping:</b>Make sure your bedroom is quiet, dark, and cool, and your bed is 
                comfortable. We often become more sensitive to noise as we age, and 
                light and heat can also cause sleep problems. Using a sound machine, 
                ear plugs, or a sleep mask can help.</li>
                <li><b>Move bedroom clocks out of view:</b> The light can disrupt your 
                sleep and anxiously watching the minutes tick by is a surefire recipe 
                for insomnia.</li>
                <li><b>Maintain a consistent sleep schedule:</b> Go to bed and wake up at the 
                same times every day, even on weekends.</li>
            </ul>
